# Introduction

This project is a sample of springMVC
Built while reading the spring in action 3rd edition
Use spring-webmvc 4.0.2
No security, no transaction, just 1 controller, 1 view jsp and 1 url: http://<host>:<port>/<context>/home

Use gradle to build, but not integrated with tomcat or jetty yet

developped with intellij idea with pleasure ;-)

The branches of this project will add other spring components
Inside a branch, tags will help to review the milestones, like new feature or new version integrated
